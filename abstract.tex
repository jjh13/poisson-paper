In this work, we cast the well-known Poisson surface reconstruction algorithm into a more general setting -- we reformulate it in terms of shift invariant spaces (spaces that are spanned by lattice translates of an admissible generating function). The treatment is general, but our specific interest is in reconstructing a surface of a solid model from an oriented point-set within function spaces defined over the body centred cubic lattice. We also propose a general framework for approximating the solution to Poisson's equation in a hypercube with zero Dirichlet boundary conditions, and a new variational scheme to re-sample the initial oriented point-set onto a regular grid. Once the points have been re-sampled onto a grid, the rest of the pipeline is purely based on digital filtering. We also analyze the error incurred via the digital filtering approximation methodology and propose a Fourier domain error kernel that can be used to design solution filters that fully exploit the approximation capabilities of the target space. Finally, we show that a host of Poisson-like methods fail to take advantage of the full approximation spaces over which they are defined.

%6. Solving Poisson?s Equation.
%This section spells out the details of the filtering methodology for solving Poisson?s equation. I will work on this part. The aim would be to condense the material so that it blends well with the rest of the paper.

%7. Results and Discussion.
% Additionally, need a subsection here that derives the filter weights for CC and BCC. The rest of the section shows the comparative surface reconstruction experimental results + discussion.
