\subsection{Experiments and Results}

\subsubsection{Cartesian Lattice}
Choosing $\mathbf{\Xii = \Xii_{C2} := \left[ I_3  \ I_3 \right]}$ (the $3 \times 6$ matrix created by the union of two identity matrices) generates a triliniear piecewise polynomial. It is easy to see, by definition, when $\mathbf{\Xii_{C2}}$ is used in conjunction with \EQp{eq:box_def}, the resulting function $M_\mathbf{\Xii_{C2}}(\vx)$ corresponds to the non-centered tensor product extension of the linear B-spline in three dimensions. Likewise, the non-centered cubic tensor product box spline is given by $M_\mathbf{\Xii_{C4}}(\vx)$, where $\mathbf{\Xii_{C4} := \left[ I_3  \ I_3 \ I_3  \ I_3 \right]}$. A box spline is easily centered by taking $M_\mathbf{\Xii}(\vx + \mathbf{c_\Xii})$, with $\mathbf{c_\Xii}:=\sum_{\xi \in \mathbf{\Xii}} \frac{1}{2}\xi$. We will assume, unless otherwise stated, that $M_\mathbf{\Xii}$ defines the centered box spline generated by $\mathbf{\Xii}$.

\subsubsection{BCC Lattice}
On the BCC lattice, a choice of {\footnotesize
\begin{equation*}
	\mathbf{\Xii_{B}} := 
	\begin{bmatrix} 
		-1 & 1 & 1 & -1 \\
		1 & -1 & 1 & -1 \\
		1 & 1 & -1 & -1 
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}}
generates a piecewise linear polynomial function \cite{practicalbox}. The support of this box spline is a rhombic dodecahedron, which incidentally contains the set of first nearest neighbors to the Voronoi region of the lattice at the origin, and is a natural fit for the lattice. The quintic box spline is given by the matrix $\mathbf{\Xii_{B2}} := \left[\mathbf{\Xii_{B}} \ \mathbf{\Xii_{B}}\right]$, or may also be seen as the convolution of the linear box spline with itself.  However, there exist both an efficient piecewise polynomial representation \cite{practicalbox}, and an efficient implementation \cite{fastbox} of these piecewise quintic polynomial functions.

\subsubsection{Shifted Basis Functions}
We also consider shifted box splines $M_{\mathbf{\Xii}}^{\xi_i}(\vx) := M_{\mathbf{\Xii}}(\vx - \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{\xi}_i)$, where $\mathbf{\xi}_i$ is any direction vector in $\mathbf{\Xii}$. In the univariate case with linear B-splines, it has been shown that introducing a shift can offer an improvement when representing scalar data \cite{linearrev}. More generally and relevant to our purposes, they have also been shown to reduce error when approximating the gradient of scalar fields \cite{gradrev}.
